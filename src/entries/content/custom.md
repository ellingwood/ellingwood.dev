My interests vary from time to time, but recently I have been re-invigorated by my love for AWS as well as a serious urge to automate everything. I was fortunate enough to buy a house this past year and I have been working on it constantly since I moved in. I am constantly tinkering and working on things like my home server, home automation, and pet projects to test my skills.

I really enjoy Golang, as it is such a fun language to create in. I love the flow of the language, and performs so well in comparison to most of my experience in Python. When I have some free time to work on 20% projects with work I have been known to re-write some of our microservices in Go to get some extra performance.
