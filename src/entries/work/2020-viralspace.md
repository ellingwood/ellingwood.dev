I was engineer #2 at Viralspace where I led the charge on developing the backend API's that all users were interacting with. I was also building out our data platform which we used to constantly update our database with new ad data, which we then used to generate insights and make predictions on ad performance.

- Lead developer of the entire backend which consisted of Flask app on EC2, ALB, Redis, and RDS (Postgres)
- Overhauled AWS infrastructure to be scalable, faster, safer, and more reliable via load balancing, autoscaling, monitoring with CloudWatch, and alerting with PagerDuty
- Built CI/CD in Bitbucket pipelines for multiple repositories and microservices in JS and Python
- Created Kubernetes architecture for building and deploying multi-tenant microservices using EKS, Flux (GitOps), Helm, and GitHub Actions, fielding 10,000 requests per minute
