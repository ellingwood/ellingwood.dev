I worked as the Senior Architect for Procoto for a year and a half, bringing a YC company back from the brink of death as the old technical co-founder had left. I was able to hire two fantastic engineers to help with the front and backend.

- Rewrote stale C++/.NET Core monolith to JavaScript (React) & Python microservice stack
- Creating scalable/best-practice version of infrastructure (i.e. load balanced, ASGâ€™s, CloudFront, etc.) from singular monolith exposed to internet without Load Balancer, Autoscaling, or a CDN for caching of static files
- Served as head of engineering, mentoring and training new hires in both frontend and backend capacities
- Developed integrations with platforms like Ironclad, Docusign, and Vizly (data visualization)
