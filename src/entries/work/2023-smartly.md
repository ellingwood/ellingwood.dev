After the aquisition of Viralspace, I transitioned to a DevOps engineer role at Smartly. Here are some of the highlights:

- Developed internal MLOps tool for rapid experimentation and easy productionisation of AI assists using AWS, Terraform, and Python
- Worked on internal tool enabling 250+ developers to start up their own stack of the entire platform in Kubernetes using namespaces and RBAC
- Developed backend service which enables any internal service to leverage LLM’s and AI assists for generative functionality, ie generating an ad campaign from a single image and prompt
- Maintained applications on 200+ EC2 instances, 10+ clusters (EKS and ”the hard way”) across many AWS accounts and Hetzner datacenter serving millions of requests globally each day
- Maintained Ansible stack for entire AWS and Hetzner infrastructure
