In the spring semester of my senior year I chose to intern at Virtusa which led to a full time offer after graduation. Some of the highlights are:

- Architected HIPAA compliant environments in AWS and Virtusa datacenters using tools such as Terraform, EC2, API Gateway, CloudFront, Lambda, Cognito, and S3
- Traveled to client sites to ensure proper launch of projects and be on site for debugging
- Worked directly with clients to develop CI/CD pipelines that integrated into their workflows using tools like Jenkins, AWS CodePipeline, and custom endpoints running deployment scripts
- Managed 100+ legacy clients/internal tools built on SaltStack, Virtusa datacenters, and AWS
- Developed suite of scripts to monitor and manage internal tooling which was critical to company services, as well as client services, including DNS, email, and hosting
- Directly interacted with key stakeholders every day to ensure proper delivery of product and maintained compliance
