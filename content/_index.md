Hey, I'm Austin. I'm a DevOps engineer based in Los Angeles who likes building tools, automating things, and occasionally writing about it.

I spend most of my time working with AWS, Kubernetes, and Go — both professionally and on side projects. When I'm not doing that, I'm probably tinkering with my home server or figuring out how to automate something that didn't need automating.

Check out the [blog](/blog/) for posts about what I'm building, or the [about](/about/) page if you want the full story.
